# 1.
hist(choco$Rating)
# The histogram seems to follow a bell curve distribution, with most of the rating being close to 3.0. The histogram is slightly skewed right.
boxplot(choco$Rating)
# Looking at the boxplot, we can see that there is an outlier with a rating of 5 and a few more outliers with ratings of 2 or lower.


# 2.
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = choco) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Cocoa.Pct, y = Rating), position = "jitter")
# Looking at the plot, there does not seem to be a significant relation between percent of cocoa and rating.
